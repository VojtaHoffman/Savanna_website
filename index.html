      <img src="World-savannas.png" alt="World's Savannas" class="picture">
      <p class="text-center normalize">The savanna biome stretches across various continents within the tropical and subtropical latitudes, typically between 15° and 30° North and South of the equator. This biome spans vast areas, covering significant portions of Africa, especially east and southern Africa, northern Australia, central Brazil, and parts of South America such as the Llanos of Venezuela and Colombia. It is not confined to a narrow band of latitude but is widespread, varying in altitude and local climatic conditions, resulting in diverse expressions of the savanna environment from the Serengeti in East Africa to the open grasslands of the Australian Outback.</p>

    <div class="under-title">
      <div class="under-title-left">
        <p class="point offset-top">The savanna biome, known for its tropical setting, exhibits a diverse range of climatic conditions due to its expansive geographical spread. This diversity renders precise climate data challenging, resulting in general climate ranges being more informative.</p>
        <h3 class="small-head">Temperature</h3>
        <p class="point indent"><b>Range:</b> The average monthly temperature in savannas oscillates between 10-20°C during the dry season and 20-30°C in the wet season.</p>
        <p class="point indent"><b>Day-Night Fluctuation:</b> A hallmark of the savanna climate is the significant difference between day and night temperatures.</p>
        <h3 class="small-head">Precipitation</h3>
        <p class="point indent"><b>Annual Rainfall:</b> Savannas typically receive between 800 and 1,600 millimeters of rain per year, decreasing as one moves farther from the equator.</p>
        <p class="point indent"><b>Seasonal Distribution:</b> Rain predominantly falls in the summer months, though the exact timing varies between hemispheres.</p>
        <h3 class="small-head">Seasonal Dynamics</h3>
        <p class="point indent"><b>Dry Season:</b> Characterized by less than 4 inches of rain per month, lasting around five months or more.</p>
        <p class="point indent"><b>Wet Season:</b> Generally commences in May in the northern hemisphere and in October in the southern hemisphere, with variable start times and durations.</p>

    <h2 class="medium-head text-middle">Current Threats</h2>
    <div class="under-title">
      <div class="under-title-left">
        <h3 class="small-head top-head">Deforestation and Land Conversion</h3>
        <p class="point indent"> In regions like the Brazilian Cerrado savanna, deforestation and land conversion for agriculture have led to significant ecological changes. This activity not only disrupts the natural vegetation but also affects water resources, as the Cerrado is a major source of water for many Brazilian river basins. The loss of native vegetation has been linked to drier conditions and reduced water availability, which in turn impacts agriculture and energy production, especially considering Brazil's heavy reliance on hydropower.</p>
        <h3 class="small-head">Overgrazing and Unsustainable Land Use</h3>
        <p class="point indent">Overgrazing by livestock, particularly in the drier parts of the African savanna, has led to severe degradation of vegetation. This overuse of the land can result in desert-like conditions, making it difficult for native plants and animals to survive. Such practices threaten the delicate balance of these ecosystems.</p>
        <h3 class="small-head">Invasive Species</h3>
        <p class="point indent">The introduction of invasive species, such as certain grasses and plants, can significantly alter the savanna's ecosystem. These species can outcompete native flora, change fire regimes, and disrupt the habitat for native wildlife. In some cases, invasive species can also act as vectors for diseases that affect native species.</p>
        <h3 class="small-head">Impact of Climate Change</h3>
        <p class="point indent">Climate change is exacerbating many of the existing threats to savannas, such as altering rainfall patterns, increasing the frequency of droughts, and raising temperatures. These changes can have a profound impact on the savanna biome, affecting everything from plant growth to animal migration patterns.</p>
        <h3 class="small-head">Loss of Large Herbivores and Biodiversity Decline</h3>
        <p class="point indent">The decline in populations of large herbivores like giraffes and elephants, mainly due to poaching and habitat loss, has an unexpected impact on savanna ecosystems. The absence of these herbivores can lead to the unchecked growth of certain plants like lianas, which can smother trees and alter the composition of plant communities.</p>
        <h3 class="small-head">Urbanization</h3>
        <p class="point indent bottom-head">Urbanization leads to habitat fragmentation and land conversion, which disrupts the natural flow of water and the balance of resources within the ecosystem. The construction associated with urban development often changes the landscape in ways that are detrimental to the natural savanna environment.</p>
